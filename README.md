Traditional cybersecurity tools often fail to monitor the highly unstructured and hidden content of darknet marketplaces. NeoSilk addresses this gap by offering an **end-to-end pipeline** that enables:

- Secure and intelligent scraping of dark web marketplaces
- Classification of illicit product listings (Drugs, Digital, Tutorials)
- Sentiment analysis of user reviews on products
- Real-time data visualization for analysts and researchers

This project was developed as part of our **Graduation Project 2025** at **Cairo University, Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence**.
